** Plotting instructions

- All files can be run without any extra input/choices once all the run scripts in the scripts folder are run.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
- For figure 3, you need to run script I_generate_all_designs.py for all the different values of
MAX_FOLD_CONC_CHANGE (2-fold, 3-fold, 10-fold, and 20-fold). To do this you need to run that script 4 different times
each time with a different value of the parameter.
- For figure S.8 c - f, you need to run script V_expression_sensitivity_of_top_designs for the different
choices of enzymes (enzyme 1 (DDPA), enzyme 2 (GLUDy), enzyme 3, and all 3 enzymes together. Once again,
you need basically run the script 4 times with a different choice of ENZ_TO_PERTURB ranging from 0 to 3.
