** Plotting instructions

- All files can be run without any extra input/choices once all the run scripts in the main scripts folder are run.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
- For figure S.12 c - f, you need to run script IV_expression_sensitivity_of_top_designs for the different
choices of enzymes (enzyme 1 (ANS), enzyme 2 (DDPA), enzyme 3, and all 3 enzymes together. Once again,
you need basically run the script 4 times with a different choice of ENZ_TO_PERTURB ranging from 0 to 3.
