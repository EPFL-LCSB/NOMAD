This folder contains all the kinetic parameter sets that needed to be loaded along with the scaffold kinetic model.

parameters_sample_3191.hdf5
- contains the kinetic parameter sets for all the models with good linearised dynamics ~151

parameters_top_9_models.hdf5
- contains the parameter sets for the 9 kinetic models that also demonstrate good growth in reactor simulations
- Their Vmaxs have already been multiplied by 3 to account for the faster growth in batch fermentations.

vmax-sensitivity
- this subfolder contains 20 sets of kinetic parameters around each of the 100 perturbed steady states for the vmax sensitivty analysis
- See supplementary note I
