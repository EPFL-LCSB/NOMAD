In this folder you will find the following files that are required for the NOMAD workflow
** tfa_samples 
- This is a csv file with around 5000 computationally generated steady state profiles
- These were generated using pyTFA and contain the following variables
-- concentrations
-- fluxes
-- Standard Gibb's free energy for all reactions
-- Thermodynamic displacement for all reactions 
-- Sample IDs 1712, 1715, 1717, 2392, 2482, 3927, 4230, 4241, 4456, 4468 are the steady-state profiles around which the
10 chosen kinetic models were parametrized

** allosteric_regulations
- This file contains a list of compiled allosteric regulations that include mixed, simple, and competitive inhibition.
- For mixed inhibition, the same inhibitor, reaction_id pair appears twice, once with simple and once with competitive inhibition.

** experiments_*
- these files contain the experimental data
- this data was obtained using webplotdigitalizer from the images provided in the paper by Hernandez et al. (2009)

** kinetic_params_top_10_models
- This is an hdf5 file containing all the kinetic parameters corresponding to each of the 10 kinetic models
- The parameters are the kms, kis (inhibition constants), maximal velocities (Vmaxs) and equilibrium constants.

** general_rxn_subsystem
- This is a file with the different reactions and the subsystems they belong to.
- It is used when generating figure 4.

** all_unique_designs.csv
- This file contains all the 41 unique designs generated by NRA for the 10 kinetic models
- The designs are shown in the enzyme-design clustermap in figure 4.
