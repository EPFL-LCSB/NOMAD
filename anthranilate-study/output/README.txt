Folder specifications:
** data 
- NOMAD results for different allowable fold chanages in concentration (3-fold, 5-fold etc.)
- Inside each subfolder you will have one folder for each of the 10 kinetic models with the NRA designs generated for that model.
- The data in these folders is used for conducting the phenotype perturbation study ( Figure 3 )
- The data for the wild typ from the 3-fold-conc-change is also used to generate Figure 2
- The data from the 3-fold-conc-change is used to collate all unique designs and generate Figures 4, 5 and 6A as well.
- The data from the runs for supplementary notes VI, VII, and VIII are also stored here.

** enzyme-sensitivity
- This folder contains the raw data when we conduct the enzyme sensitivty study
- For each % age perturbation - eg. 50% we have a new subfolder
- The subfolder then has subfolders for the enzyme that was perturbed - eg. enz 0 (DDPA), enz 1 (GLUDy), enz 2 (HEX1/PYK etc. or all three enzymes
- The data in this subfolder is used to generate the plots for Figure 7 C-F

** verification top 5 designs in reactor
- This folder contains the results for when we test the top 5 designs in all the 10 models using the NRA suggested values specific to each model.
- This data is used to generate Figure 7A and 7B
